## The LIRC remote configurations project.

The LIRC project is about managing IR remotes. For each remote used, there
should be a configuration file. This project manages these files.

The configurations here should be usable in current LIRC versions and also in
winLIRC. However, the real purpose of this project is to provide a better
foundation for configuration tools. These tools are in (in the time of writing
upcoming) 0.9.2 version.

The documentation for lirc-remotes is in the
[project wiki](http://sf.net/p/lirc-remotes/wiki)
